The best carrier oil for perfumery depends on personal preference and the desired outcome. Here are a few popular options:

Jojoba oil: Jojoba oil is a light and easily absorbed oil that is similar in composition to the skin's natural sebum. This makes it an excellent choice for perfumery as it doesn't interfere with the scent of the essential oils.

Fractionated Coconut Oil: This is a light and non-greasy oil that is easily absorbed into the skin. It is also stable and has a long shelf life, making it a popular choice for perfumes and other scented products.

Grapeseed oil: Grapeseed oil is light and easily absorbed, making it a popular choice for perfumes and other scented products. It is also odorless and does not interfere with the scent of the essential oils.

Sweet Almond Oil: Sweet almond oil is a rich and nourishing oil that is easily absorbed into the skin. It is a good choice for perfumery as it has a subtle, nutty scent that blends well with a wide range of essential oils.

Ultimately, the best carrier oil for perfumery will depend on personal preference and the desired outcome. You may need to experiment with different carrier oils to find the one that works best for you.
