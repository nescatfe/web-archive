Nostr Relies on Relays

There is no Nostr app, there is no Nostr website; there is no Nostr company.
	Nostr is a protocol that provides censorship-resistant communications on
	the internet. Nostr uses dumb relays forward messages from one user to another.

Anyone can spin up a private and public key pair, connect to a relay via a client
	of their choice and broadcast their information, in many cases a post, to one
	or several relays.

Instead of logging into Twitter and posting your text message to their cloud storage
	servers, which is then recalled by others who use Twitter and wish to see your content,
	with Nostr, you’re posting your content to relays that allow for public submissions.
	You can get public relays or private relays that are invite-only or you can run your
	own relay and have a party of one; it’s all up to your preference.
